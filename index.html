        <h2>Greetings soldier!</h2>
        <p>
          GrandMini Studios is a Swedish indie game studio focusing on simple
          and user-friendly computer games. We are driven by a strong interest
          in Sweden's fantastic history and especially Sweden's military
          history. This interest is something we want to share with as many
          people as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us present the world's first hexagon-based war game about the
          Great Northern War - Great Battles of Carolus XII. Visit our website
          below:

        <h2>Join our journey to honour the history of Sweden!</h2>
        <p>
          Today you can buy a copy of Great Battles of Carolus XII and take part
          in our journey as we create the world's first hexagon-based war game
          focused on the Great Northern War. Great Battles of Carolus XII is
          also the first game to depict the Great Northern War from a unique
          Swedish perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
          Great Battles of Carolus XII already contains several detailed
          historical maps and we are also continuously working with adding more
          maps and improving the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          GrandMini Studios can today proudly present our goals for 2023:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The campaign map will be visually and functionally improved.</li>
             <li>The 3D models will be animated and optimized. They will also be given better textures and unique uniforms based on regiment affiliation</li>
          <li>
            More historical maps/battles from the Great Northern War 1700-1709
            will be added in the upcoming updates. We want the maps to be varied
            and the game to reflect the entire Carolean campaign. Sometime in
            the future, we want all battles with significant historical weight
            to be in the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            More documentary-like movies will be added to the game. We will
            create a written manual along with a video tutorial series.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="indexdel">
        <h2>Our ambition</h2>
        <p>
          Our project is inspired by historical events but does not claim to be
          historically correct in all respects. The game also does not claim to
          be deeply strategic. The game merely strives to be uncomplicated and
          entertaining. In this simple historical strategy game, the player
          commands the Swedish army and defeats the enemies of Svea Rike.
        </p>
        <p>
          So do not hesitate! Visit our Steam page today to buy the game or add
          it to your wishlist. Now you have the opportunity to perform great
          deeds and experience Stormaktstiden. Overcome seemingly impossible
          odds and defeat enemies who do everything they can to crush the
          kingdom of Sweden!
